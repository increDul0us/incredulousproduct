This project is deployed on Heroku at https://immense-sea-46975.herokuapp.com/
The Database used was the online mongoDb, hence data might not load immediately.

#Future improvements:
1. Add loader
2. Add signin and login (Authorisation and Authentication)
3. Use heroku db to save images so that they can be loaded immediately
